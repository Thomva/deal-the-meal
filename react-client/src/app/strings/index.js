This can be leftovers, food they don\'t like, homemade food, etc.<br><br>Others can buy/claim this food. This makes it easier for the less fortunate to get food and taste new things. People who love to cook or grow food themselves can easily share (or sell) it to people in the area.<br><br>This is a project made for Mobile Development II within the programme New Media Development @ Artevelde University of Applied Sciences.';
